# MonolithToMicroserviceApi
An example repo for web api projects to demo deploying multiple api's as a single entity.

There is a blog post online to complement the code which explores how things work and why things are setup as they are. See https://blog.boro2g.co.uk/monolith-microservice-or-something-in-between/ for more info.

**Running the solution:**

The sample endpoints are:

 - Root project
	 - /weatherforecast
 - Weather api
	 - /weatherforecast_specific
 - Search
	 - /search?searchTerm=cat
